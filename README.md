# Electricity-Consumption-Forecasting

This was my final project for the Data Science Course in Digital House, and was made along my partners and friends Juan Sirai and Camila Panizza.

For this project we worked with the Kaggle's dataset 'Smart meters in London' that can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london?select=daily_dataset.zip.

Note: the 'data' folder that is needed for the Jupyter Notebooks to work must be downloaded from the source page. The data file fully unzipped size is approximately 8 GB.
